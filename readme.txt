== Description ==

This is my first plugins in WordPress, I really hope this gonna be useful for all.
Bee Offline is plugin that give you a room and freedom to editing and upgrading your WP but not display the error message if
there is something wrong while editing or upgrading your site, it's just show "Under Construction" page on screen.

You can change style of your offline page by editing file construction.php inside bee-offline folder.

<strong>Changes 1.4</strong>

- Support WordPress Multi Site or WPMU.

<strong>Changes 1.3</strong>

- You can choose more than one user role that still can view site while offline.

<strong>Changes 1.2</strong>

- Link www.example.com/?trial=yes is not used anymore.
- you still can view your web as long as you logged in and you have administrator access.

I change this because if use GET variable you can't check your another page while offline.

== Installation ==

1. extract "bee-offline.zip" and upload the folder bee-offline to your plugin folder on site, ussually /public_html/wp-content/plugins/
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
